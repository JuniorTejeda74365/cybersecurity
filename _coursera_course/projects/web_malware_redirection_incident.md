Network Protocol Identified

The network protocols identified in the packet captures were DNS (Domain Name System) and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). DNS operates at the Application layer of the TCP/IP model and was used to resolve the domain names yummyrecipesforme.com and greatrecipesforme.com into IP addresses. HTTP also operates at the Application layer and was used to request and retrieve web content from both websites after DNS resolution occurred.

Incident Documentation

A security incident occurred involving the website yummyrecipesforme.com, which is hosted by the organization. The incident was discovered after multiple customers contacted the helpdesk reporting that the website prompted them to download a file and that their browsers were redirected to a different website. Customers also reported decreased system performance after executing the downloaded file.

The cybersecurity team investigated the incident using a sandbox environment and the network protocol analyzer tcpdump. Packet captures showed that the source computer initiated a DNS request to resolve the domain name yummyrecipesforme.com, followed by an HTTP connection to retrieve the webpage. The captured traffic showed an HTTP GET request over port 80, after which additional traffic occurred on the same port.

Further packet captures showed a second DNS request for the domain greatrecipesforme.com, followed by another HTTP connection to that domain. This indicated that the browser was redirected to a different website after the initial page load. Analysis of the website source code confirmed that malicious JavaScript had been added to prompt users to download an executable file and redirect them to the malicious website.

Additional investigation revealed that the web server had been compromised through a brute force attack. A former employee repeatedly attempted default passwords until they successfully accessed the administrative account. After gaining access, the attacker modified the website’s source code and changed the administrative password, preventing the legitimate owner from logging in. Evidence for this investigation included tcpdump packet captures, customer reports, and source code analysis.

Recommended Remediation

To prevent brute force attacks in the future, the organization should limit the number of login attempts allowed for administrative accounts. This security measure is effective because it prevents attackers from repeatedly guessing passwords. Once the maximum number of failed login attempts is reached, the account can be temporarily locked or additional verification can be required. Limiting login attempts significantly reduces the likelihood of successful brute force attacks and helps protect administrative access to critical systems.
